# Zelda: Back in Time
---
Our game is going to be a reminder from the past. We are going to create a game that is similar to some of the very first Zelda games.

## Main Screen
---
The main screen will have a picture of our game in the background with a play button and an info button.

## Info Button
---
When the info button is clicked, a new screen will appear which will inform the user of what keys will be used in our game to control our Link. It will also have the purpose of the game so the user knows how to win the game.

## Play Button
---
When the play button is clicked, a new screen will appear. This will be our first room.  We are going to create a total of three rooms that the Link can move between.

## Three Rooms
---
Each room will have different obstacles that will hinder Link's movements (he will have to go around them), a "bad guy" that will chase him (if he is caught, he will lose a life), keys for Link to find, food for link to eat to improve his health, and a display of how many lives he has and how many keys he has found.

## Purpose
---
The purpose of our game is for Link to find all the hidden keys in the three rooms before he runs out of life.

## Win Screen
---
When the player finds all the keys and has lives, a win screen/message will appear that will congratulating the player for their victory. They will also have a chance to be able to play again.

## No More Lives Left Screen
---
When the player dies from having no more lives, a game over screen/message will appear. There will also be a chance to try again.
